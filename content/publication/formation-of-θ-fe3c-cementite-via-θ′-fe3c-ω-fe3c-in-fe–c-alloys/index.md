abstract: Cementite (θ-Fe3C), as a well-known hard-phase particle, makes carbon
  steel strong and hard. As for the carbide formed from the Fe−C martensite
  structure, θ-Fe3C has been traditionally believed to precipitate from the
  martensite via a classical nucleation and grain growth mechanism. However,
  recent experimental results have revealed that the ω-Fe3C fine carbide
  particles in the twin-boundary region of twinned Fe−C martensite are a
  potential precursor of θ-Fe3C carbides. These ω-Fe3C fine particles can
  transform into θ′-Fe3C carbide particles via a particle-coarsening process
  without involving any atomic movement. Interestingly, the metastable θ′-Fe3C
  carbide has a similar crystal structure to that of θ-Fe3C, and both have the
  same amount of iron and carbon atoms (12Fe + 4C) in their unit cells. Thus, a
  θ′-Fe3C (ω-Fe3C) → θ-Fe3C transformation path has been proposed with the
  transformation mechanism investigated crystallographically. Transmission
  electron microscopy observations on the quenched high carbon Fe−C binary
  alloys have confirmed that a large θ-Fe3C particle is actually composed of a
  great number of ultrafine θ-Fe3C grains with almost the same crystal
  orientation, or the coarsening of a θ-Fe3C particle can be attributed to the
  aggregation of numerous ultrafine θ-Fe3C grains, which are transformed from
  ω-Fe3C via the path ω-Fe3C → ω′-Fe3C → θ′-Fe3C → θ-Fe3C.
