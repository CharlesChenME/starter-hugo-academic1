abstract: The structural stability and physical properties of the Fe(III)
  carbodiimide Fe2(NCN)3 were studied by use of density functional theory. The
  results indicate that Fe2(NCN)3 (space group R3C ) is stable both
  thermodynamically and mechanically. The electronic structure in combination
  with the phonon dispersion relations suggest that the title compound should be
  ferromagnetic and half-metallic, and that the Fe3+ ions are in the low-spin
  state.
