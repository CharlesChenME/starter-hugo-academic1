  The structural stability and physical properties of the Fe(III) carbodiimide
  Fe2(NCN)3 were studied by use of density functional theory. The results
  indicate that Fe2(NCN)3 (space group R3c) is stable both thermodynamically

  and mechanically. The electronic structure in combination with the phonon dispersion relations suggest that the title compound should be ferromagnetic and half-metallic, and that the Fe3+ ions are in the low-spin state.
