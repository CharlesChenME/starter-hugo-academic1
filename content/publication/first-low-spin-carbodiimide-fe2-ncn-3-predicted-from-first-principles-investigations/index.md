abstract: The structural stability and physical properties of the Fe(III)
  carbodiimide Fe<sub>2</sub>(NCN)<sub>3</sub> were studied by use of density
  functional theory. The results indicate that Fe<sub>2</sub>(NCN)<sub>3</sub>
  (space group R3c) is stable both thermodynamically and mechanically. The
  electronic structure in combination with the phonon dispersion relations
  suggest that the title compound should be ferromagnetic and half-metallic, and
  that the Fep<sup>3+</sup> ions are in the low-spin state.
