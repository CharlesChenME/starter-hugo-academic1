abstract: Carbon steel is strong primarily because of carbides with the most
  well-known one being θ-Fe3C type cementite. However, the formation mechanism
  of cementite remains unclear. In this study, a new metastable carbide
  formation mechanism was proposed as ω-Fe<sub>3</sub>C → ω′-Fe3C → θ′-Fe3C
  based on the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation. Results shown
  that in quenched high-carbon binary alloys, hexagonal ω-Fe3C fine particles
  are distributed in the martensite twinning boundary alone, while two
  metastable carbides (ω′ and θ′) coexist in the quenched pearlite. These two
  carbides both possess orthorhombic crystal structure with different lattice
  parameters (aθ′ = aω′ = aω = 2aα-Fe = 4.033 Å, bθ′ = 2 × bω′ = 2 × cω = 3aα-Fe
  = 4.94 Å, and cθ′ = cω′ = 3aω = 6.986 Å for aα-Fe = 2.852 Å). The θ′ unit cell
  can be constructed simply by merging two ω′ unit cells together along its bω′
  axis. Thus, the θ′ unit cell contains 12 Fe atoms and 4 C atoms, which in turn
  matches the composition and atomic number of the θ-Fe3C cementite unit cell.
  The proposed theory in combination with experimental results gives a new
  insight into the carbide formation mechanism in Fe-C martensite.
