abstract: Carbon steel is strong primarily because of carbides with the most
  well-known one being θ-Fe<sub>3</sub>C type cementite. However, the formation
  mechanism of cementite remains unclear. In this study, a new metastable
  carbide formation mechanism was proposed as ω-Fe<sub>3</sub>C →
  ω′-Fe<sub>3</sub>C → θ′-Fe<sub>3</sub>C based on the transmission electron
  microscopy (TEM) observation. Results shown that in quenched high-carbon
  binary alloys, hexagonal ω-Fe3C fine particles are distributed in the
  martensite twinning boundary alone, while two metastable carbides (ω′ and θ′)
  coexist in the quenched pearlite. These two carbides both possess orthorhombic
  crystal structure with different lattice parameters (a<sub>θ′</sub> =
  a<sub>ω′</sub> = a<sub>ω</sub> = 2a<sub>α-Fe</sub> = 4.033 Å, b<sub>θ′</sub> =
  2 × b<sub>ω′</sub> = 2 × c<sub>ω</sub> = 3a<sub>α-Fe </sub>= 4.94 Å, and
  c<sub>θ′ </sub>= c<sub>ω′</sub> = 3a<sub>ω</sub> = 6.986 Å for
  a<sub>α-Fe</sub> = 2.852 Å). The θ′ unit cell can be constructed simply by
  merging two ω′ unit cells together along its bω′ axis. Thus, the θ′ unit cell
  contains 12 Fe atoms and 4 C atoms, which in turn matches the composition and
  atomic number of the θ-Fe<sub>3</sub>C cementite unit cell. The proposed
  theory in combination with experimental results gives a new insight into the
  carbide formation mechanism in Fe-C martensite.
